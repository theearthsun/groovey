        <h2>THE CLEANING PROCESS</h2>
        <ol class="cleaning-list">
            <li>Remove surface dust / grim using a clean carbon fibre brush.</li>
            <li>Literally apply the PULSATIN PRE CLEAN to the side of record to be cleaned. Try to cover the whole of half record but avoid the centre label.</li>
            <li>Place the record on a clean lint free Towel / Mat and rub the PULSATIN PRE CLEAN SOULTION at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock. Follow the grooves in full circles with gentle force.</li>
            <li>Using a clean goats hair brush, brush the "PULSATIN PRE CLEAN SOULTION" into the grooves. Follow the groove in both directions 8 times. Pay special attention to any finger printed areas, leave to sink into grooves for 8 minutes before moving to other side.</li>
            <li>Complete both sides by repeating the steps.</li>
            <li>Rinse off well with fresh distilled water.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps (2, 3 and 4) but swap the pre clean solution with the "PULSATIN VINYL SURFACTANT MIXER" BB, AB, PP OR AP.</li>
            <li>Leave for 8 minutes before moving record to next stage!</li>
        </ol>
