        <h2>THE CLEANING PROCESS</h2>
        <div class="cleaning-section">
            <p>Remove surface dust / grim using a clean carbon fibre brush.</p>
            <p>Literally apply the PULSATIN PRE CLEAN to the side of the record to be cleaned. Try to cover the whole half record but avoid the centre label.</p>
            <p>Place the record on a clean lint free towel / Mat and rub the required PULSATIN surfactant at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock. Follow the grooves in full circles with gentle force.</p>
            <p>Using a clean goats hair brush, brush into the grooves. Follow the groove in both directions 8 times. Pay special attention to any fingerprinted areas, leave to sink into grooves for 8 minutes before moving to other side.</p>
            <p>Complete both sides by repeating the steps.</p>
            <p>Rinse off well with fresh distilled water.</p>
            <p>Repeat steps (2, 3 and 4).</p>
            <p>Leave for 8 minutes before moving record to next stage!</p>
            <p>Rinse clean with distilled water. Allow to fully dry.</p>
